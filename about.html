		<div class="text">this website started with the idea of practicing the art of one line on a daily basis with a project called “one stroke a day” – a blog with posts of one line drawings each inspired by the day they were created. as time passed, the drawings became more than just an exercise; they became memories. and so, the one line project turned into a one line diary. enjoy the journey!</div>
