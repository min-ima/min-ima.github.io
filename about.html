			this website started with the idea of practicing the art of one line drawings on a daily basis with a project called “one stroke a day” – a blog with posts of one line drawings each inspired by the day they were created. as time passed, the drawings became more than just an exercise; they became memories, messages and linguistic-visual jokes. and so, the one line project turned into a one line diary into means of expression.  </div>

			<h3>MIN-IMAlism</h3>
			minimalism has fascinated me for a long time. it can be found anywhere; on any mundane object, in our dear nature, in people’s lifestyles, in thoughts, in any form of art. the beauty about it is that everything minimal is maximally perfected in its most necessary features – it is its pure truth. one of my favourite examples of perfect minimalism: the tooth pick. and yet, embellishment does not mean imperfection – it can perfect the embellished. to me, minimalism is not about erasing redundant elements but emphasize the crucial ones. it is about discovering the very heart of things, finding all that matters.
